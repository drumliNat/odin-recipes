    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Smoking hot oil and super-hot oven <br>

            It is essential that your oven and the oil that you cook the batter in is smoking hot.
            You must heat the greased muffin tin for at least 5-10 minutes prior to adding the batter.
            When you ladle in the batter it should sizzle as soon as it hits the oil.
            If it doesn't, put your muffin tin back in the oven until you hear that sizzle.</li>

        <li>Fat matters <br>

            Traditionally meat was roasted on a spit, and the Yorkshire's were
            cooked underneath by the dripping fat. These days, the beef
            drippings are placed in the muffin tin with a spoon, and the batter is
            cooked in the drippings. You can of course use olive oil/vegetable oil,
            but beef drippings certainly bring extra flavor. If you are using oil,
            remember that the best oil to
            make Yorkshire puddings will have a high smoke point.</li>

        <li> The right tin <br>

            Some people make them in a large tray for convenience,
            but I think it's worth making them in a non-stick muffin
            tin as you get maximum crispy edges. Popover tins can be used,
            but they'll result in a firmer style Yorkshire pudding.
            Whatever tin you do use, make sure it's a heavy tin which won't warp at a high temperature.</li>

        <li>Resist! <br>

            Do not open that oven door in the first 15 minutes of cooking.
            If you are the impatient type, switch on the oven light, and
            gaze in through the glass to keep an eye on them.
            If you do open the oven door before they are puffed up
            and golden bronze in color, they'll deflate immediately.</li>

        <li>Timing must be just right <br>

            You must have all the elements of your meal ready just in time for the puddings
            to come out of the oven. When the Yorkshire puddings land, the rest of your
            dinner better be served on a plate. There is nothing worse than a sad, cold,
            deflated Yorkshire pudding. It takes a bit of practice, but when you make
            your own Yorkshire puddings with your roast dinner on a regular basis
            you will become an expert at getting them just right.</li>
